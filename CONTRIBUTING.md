# Contributing to FWDP Repositories

Welcome! 👋  
Thank you for your interest in contributing to projects under the
**Filipino Web Development Peers (FWDP)** GitHub organization.

These guidelines apply to **all repositories** unless a repository
states otherwise.

---

## Who Can Contribute

- Students
- Community contributors
- Mentors and maintainers

We welcome all skill levels. Learning is encouraged.

---

## How to Contribute (Standard Workflow)

1. **Find an issue**
   - Look for `good first issue` if you’re new

2. **Fork the repository**
   - Do not push directly to `main`

3. **Create a branch**
    - feature/*"short-description"*
    - hotfix/*"short-description"* (for production environments)

4. **Make your changes**
- Keep changes focused
- Follow existing code style

5. **Open a Pull Request**
- Fill out the PR template
- Explain what you changed and why

6. **Review & Merge**
- Mentors and maintainers will review
- CI must pass (if applicable)

---

## Branch Rules

- Direct pushes to `main` are not allowed
- All changes go through Pull Requests
- Approval is required before merging

---

## Repository Tiers (Important)

FWDP repositories are classified into tiers:

- **Tier 0** – Sandbox / Learning  
- Relaxed rules
- Students may have write access

- **Tier 1+** – Community & Official Projects  
- Pull Requests required
- CI required
- Branch protection enabled

If you’re unsure what tier a repo is in, check the **FWDP Governance repository**.

---

## Code Quality Expectations

- Write clear commit messages
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Update documentation if behavior changes
- Ask questions if unsure — that’s encouraged

---

## Repository Naming Conventions

To keep the FWDP GitHub organization consistent, searchable, and easy to
maintain, all new repositories must follow these naming conventions.

Repository names should be **clear, descriptive, and predictable**.

---

### General Rules

- Use **lowercase letters only**
- Use **hyphens (`-`)** as word separators
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood
- Avoid version numbers in repository names
- Avoid personal names or inside jokes

**Good examples**
- `fwdp-org-website`
- `student-portfolio-tracker`
- `community-job-board`

**Bad examples**
- `FinalProjectV2`
- `JuanApp`
- `test123`
- `myCoolRepo`

---

### Optional Prefixes (Recommended)

Use prefixes to indicate purpose when helpful:

| Prefix | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `fwdp-` | Official FWDP assets |
| `student-` | Student-led projects |
| `community-` | Community experiments |
| `template-` | Repository templates |
| `demo-` | Demonstrations or examples |

**Examples**
- `fwdp-repo-template`
- `student-react-todo`
- `community-event-platform`
- `template-laravel-api`

---

### Technology-Based Suffixes (Optional)

If useful, repositories may include a technology suffix:

- `-frontend`
- `-backend`
- `-api`
- `-mobile`
- `-infra`

**Examples**
- `fwdp-job-board-frontend`
- `community-chat-api`

---

### What Not to Include

Do **not** include:
- Programming language names unless necessary
- Environment names (`prod`, `dev`, `final`)
- Version numbers (`v1`, `v2`, `final`)
- Dates

Versioning belongs in **tags and releases**, not repository names.

---

### Template Requirement

All new repositories must be created using the official
**FWDP Base Repository Template** unless explicitly approved otherwise.

This ensures that documentation, contribution rules, and CI
are present from the start.

---

### Enforcement

- Repositories that do not follow these conventions may be renamed
- Repeated violations may require approval from Platform Maintainers


## Code of Conduct

All contributors must follow the FWDP Code of Conduct.

Be respectful. Be constructive. Be professional.

---

## Security Issues

⚠️ **Do NOT open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Follow the instructions in `SECURITY.md` for responsible disclosure.
