# Contributing to FWDP Repositories

Welcome! 👋  
Thank you for your interest in contributing to projects under the
**Filipino Web Development Peers (FWDP)** GitHub organization.

These guidelines apply to **all repositories** unless a repository
states otherwise.

---

## Who Can Contribute

- Students
- Community contributors
- Mentors and maintainers

We welcome all skill levels. Learning is encouraged.

---

## How to Contribute (Standard Workflow)

1. **Find an issue**
   - Look for `good first issue` if you’re new

2. **Fork the repository**
   - Do not push directly to `main`

3. **Create a branch**
    - feature/<short-description>
    - hotfix/<short-description> (for production environments)

4. **Make your changes**
- Keep changes focused
- Follow existing code style

5. **Open a Pull Request**
- Fill out the PR template
- Explain what you changed and why

6. **Review & Merge**
- Mentors and maintainers will review
- CI must pass (if applicable)

---

## Branch Rules

- Direct pushes to `main` are not allowed
- All changes go through Pull Requests
- Approval is required before merging

---

## Repository Tiers (Important)

FWDP repositories are classified into tiers:

- **Tier 0** – Sandbox / Learning  
- Relaxed rules
- Students may have write access

- **Tier 1+** – Community & Official Projects  
- Pull Requests required
- CI required
- Branch protection enabled

If you’re unsure what tier a repo is in, check the **FWDP Governance repository**.

---

## Code Quality Expectations

- Write clear commit messages
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Update documentation if behavior changes
- Ask questions if unsure — that’s encouraged

---

## Code of Conduct

All contributors must follow the FWDP Code of Conduct.

Be respectful. Be constructive. Be professional.

---

## Security Issues

⚠️ **Do NOT open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Follow the instructions in `SECURITY.md` for responsible disclosure.
